// Package session holds the agent-neutral view of a session tree.
//
// Every agent stores its history differently. Each one resolves its own
// quirks — where a title hides, what counts as noise, whether archiving
// exists at all — and hands back the types here. Nothing in this package
// touches the filesystem, runs a command, or renders anything, so the rules
// that decide what an action really affects can be tested on their own.
